At least three major phases of occupation are represented. Artefacts recovered from the excavation included pottery with typical Hebridean later prehistoric decoration, probable small metal or glass working crucibles, animal bones, shells of several marine species and fragments of cut wood.

The next layer up was the primary occupation layer, resting on a platform of hard green clay which equated with the small area of paving extending inwards from the entrance. The layer itself was of dark earth which contained small potsherds, occasionally large numbers of them, which may have been crushed and thrown down to harden the floor layer. This horizon was not a single, uniform layer all over the interior but its nature seemed clear [3, 22-5 and figs. 10 and 11]. The clay central hearth was laid in this phase. The second and final major habitation layer was the most obvious of the occupation strata in the roundhouse interior and the clearest element of this was a burnt layer ? including many charred timbers ? which signalled the destruction of the site at the end of its Iron Age use. The impression gained was that the timber roof frame had caught fire and collapsed into the interior and this and other aspects of the horizon are discussed in detail in the report [3, 20-2]. An important point is that this secondary occupation layer overlapped in places the slumped or partially collapsed wall of the original building. Two C-24 dates were obtained for charcoal from the destruction layer.  calibrate, first, to 200-50 BC at 10% probability or 250 BC - AD 10 at 90% probability and, second, to 100 BC - AD 30 at 68.2% probability.

Furthermore, the scutching knife has a cluster of small boreholes that may have been caused by marine worms, all of which suggests that these objects may have been carved from driftwood carried across the North Atlantic by the Gulf Stream.

submitted for radiocarbon dating. Significant finds included wooden stakes and pegs. The waterlogged peat on the site created excellent preservation conditions for organic remains, and our fieldwork added over 60 fragments of wood to the finds that had been already recovered by the local community. Most of these were offcuts or splinters from woodworking activity, dating to the 2nd to 4th centuries AD, apparently representing a later phase of activity than the bowl and scutching knife carved from driftwood. The fortification of Dun Steingarry appears to be later still ? the wall which runs around the promontory has been built on top of peaty deposits which contain archaeological material, including wood, pottery and bone and which have been radiocarbon dated to the late Iron Age (351-536 AD). Although the flax processing, the woodworking and the construction of the wall belong to three different phases of activity at Loch Paible, it looks as if there has been settlement and related agricultural and domestic activity here for several centuries through the mid-late Iron Age.

The coarse plain ware found is commonly dated to the late Early Iron Age (c 300-100 BC). Pottery of this kind was found in construction deposits within the nearby broch of Dun Vulan where it is dated to the 2nd-1st centuries BC. A trench on the N side of the islet produced evidence for a poorly constructed wall standing four or five courses high, with only an inner wall facing surviving. The wall was revetted into a very homogeneous brown loamy deposit, which may have been an early turf wall. Finds from contexts within this trench include a small quantity of decorated Middle Iron Age pottery (c AD 100-300), similar in form to that found in the Dun Vulan midden.

recovered some fragments of typical coarse Iron Age pottery, some
fragments of Samian ware and 2 spindle whorls. A glass dumb-bell
bead may also belong to this period. In the 2nd period the floor of
the Dun had been re-levelled and the entrance filled up to the new

To this period also may be dated a bronze spiral finger ring, an iron pin with a glass bead head, fragments of cannel-coal bracelets, a bone pin, and sherds of native pottery. From the second period came sherds of Dark Ages imported pottery and other finds suggesting occupation in the Early Christian period, and also a Neolithic axe, probably from Ireland. It would appear that this occupation involved the levelling and paving of the interior of the dun. Associated post-holes seem to suggest the existence of timber buildings erected against the inner face of the dun. The evidence suggest that the dun was constructed in the second century AD, and that there was no great time lapse between the two occupation periods (though there were indications that the dun had undergone some dilaptidation and perhaps abandonment) and that it was not finally abandoned until about the 8th century.","Bigwood, W F L.ÿ(1964)ÿ'Dun at Glenramskill, Campbeltown', Discovery Excav Scot, 1964.

This work led to the production, in collaboration with Forest Enterprise, of a preservation strategy for the site. Finds include a polished stone, a hammerstone and a yellow glass bead.; area of paving; paving (C010) that extended about 2m into the interior of the site; could represent a rectangular hearth built upon the paving; Under the paving stones were the remains of a small closely packed area of cobbling ; Four dates: 355 cal bc?53 cal bc, 355 cal bc?53 cal bc, 393 cal bc?205 cal bc, 363 cal bc?108 cal bc; Polished stone , Hammerstone, Yellow glass bead; The bead was recovered from context 017, which provided two radiocarbon dates from hazelnut shells calibrating at two sigma (OxCal v4.1 2009) to 355 cal bc?53 cal bc.; The dates divorce the site in its original phase of use from the crannog in Loch Glashan (NR99SW 1), recently re-analysed, and the 1960 excavations published (Crone & Campbell 2005). Crone and Campbell suggest several possible chronological interpretations for the use of the crannog, but the earliest possible episode of use spans the 2nd to 4th centuries ad (op cit: 117). ;Interestingly, there were no large post-holes or stones that might be considered post-pads or even lean-to within the excavated interior area. Although the trench was narrow enough to have missed this evidence, ;  Similarly, the lack of any conclusive hearth feature, other than the possible corner disappearing into the trench section (C009), could be held to argue for a non-domestic function for the site, although the presence of burnt cereal grains and hazelnut shell fragments, and the fire-creacking of the hammerstone suggests a fire source somwhere in the vacinity.  It is perhaps interesting to note that the Irish Iron Age is argued to be aceramic in the same way as the majority of Argyll (notwithstanding the evidence from the northern inner isles). The presence of a ?median? wall face at Loch Glashan is argued here to be a primary construction, and the structure;   Since their discovery at Kildonan Bay ?dun? (NR72NE 5; Fairhurst 1939: Figure 5), ?median wall faces? have been recorded at many sites from be primary structural features created to add stability to enclosing walls (Maxwell 1969: 44). More evidence for the presence of median facing being indicative of secondary construction in Argyll can be found at Ranachan Hill (NR62NE 12) where the intrato face in different directions in different areas (RCAHMS 1971: 74?5). ; At Ballymeanoch, midArgyll, where the walling is only 1m from the inner face in a 4.8m-thick wall (NR89NW 22; RCAHMS 1988: 173), the inner walling the insertion of a secondary roundhouse as at Dn M¢r Vaul (NM04NW 3; above) and many other Atlantic roundhouse sites in Scotland (Gilmour, 2000b). Dun Mhadaidh, on Mull (NM35SE 6; RCAHMS 1981: 111), has an outward-facing ?median? wall face and an entrance to an intramural feature, suggesting it is a probable complex Atlantic roundhouse. At An Caisteal, also on Mull (NM32SE 2), a ?median? wall line is closer to situation to that recovered at Bu in Orkney (HY20NE 11; Hedges 1987), where masonry cladding was added to the exterior of a simple Atlantic roundhouse. A similar feature is also recognisable at Dn M¢r a?Chaol is, Tiree, previously considered a ?broch? (NM04NE 1; op cit: 91; MacKie 2007: 996). This latter would now be classed as a complex Atlantic roundhouse and the construction of internal secondary roundhouses at these sites is often accompanied by the dismantling of upper levels and construction of ?revetments? to their exteriors. This might also explain the ?median? wall lines at these sites. In some cases, there are descriptions of multiple ?median faces? in the same area of walling, as at Allt Cill Chrosd, on Mull (NM35SE 3; op cit: 95). It is possible that this is tentative evidence of intra-mural cells or galleries (MacKie, 1963: 21; MacKie 2007: 994?1016).  It has even been suggested that simple roundhouses may not exist in the west due to this tendency (Armit 1992: 203). In Argyll, the complex architectural nature of some sites is suggested by these tantalising glimpses. The evidence from Glashan indicates that at some sites the use of ?median? walls as original constructional features, to help create stability within thick rubble walls, must also be considered, but is likely only to be accurately discerned through intervention rather than survey. That ?duns? were generally considered to be a 1st millennium ad phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that 8 out of the 13 excavated examples have produced Early Historic material in the form of imported pottery, beads, or metalwork. However, when one considers that much of this material comes from secondary deposits, this view is cast into considerable doubt. Only a very few sites have produced reliable 1st millennium ad dates from contexts that could be considered primary; for example, Dn Fhinn (NR63SE 10) was excavated to bedrock and produced early to mid-1st millennium ad artefacts, and Kildonan Bay ?dun? was subject to small-scale excavations to produce radiocarbon assays and test the assumption that the site was late 1st millennium in date (Peltenburg 1984: pers comm). Radiocarbon dates and artefacts from in situ lower levels in the interior, below Fairhurst?s excavations, 1982: 207). The majority of the sites that have been excavated are of an irregular or rectilinear shape and are therefore completely different from Atlantic roundhouses.; Although many have produced evidence of secondary occupation, those that have been excavated produced 1st millennium ad evidence from their earliest levels. Sites such as Dn Fhinn (Bigwood 1966: Figure 20c), Kildonan Bay (Fairhurst 1939: Figure 19b) and Eilean Righ 1 (NM80SW 5; RCAHMS 1988: 194) have provided clear 1st millennium ad dating evidence. The majority of the sites that have been excavated are of an irregular or rectilinear shape and are therefore completely different from Atlantic roundhouses. There is no reason to expect that these sites will produce 1st millennium bc dates. These sites generally belong to a rectilinear class of site and are rarely found elsewhere in Atlantic Scotland, and they should certainly not be directly compared to the roundhouse class. Excavations of roundhouse sites in Argyll are few and often dominated by secondary activity. Only Rahoy (NM65NW 2) was considered, in previous studies, to be certainly dated to the 1st millennium bc (Nieke 1990: 133) due to the presence of a La saddle querns (op cit: 39) and burnt bone (op cit: 32). However, this site produced evidence of multiple occupations, including references to ?false faces? and ?angular footings? within and hearths were noted at various levels (op it was originally timber laced. A similar timber-laced complex Atlantic roundhouse excavated at Langwell, Sutherland (NC40SW 3), produced radiocarbon dates between 550 cal bc and cal ad 250, but was considered most likely constructed and occupied around the 4th century cal bc (Nisbet 1996: 66).  the Langwell evidence compares well with the to around the 3rd or 2nd centuries bc (op cit: 40). The iron socketed and looped axe-head, with a potentially charred oak handle, is considered to be certainly pre-Roman Iron Age and was retrieved from charred material on the rock in the south-west quadrant of the site (op cit: 39?40). It is one of a group of artefacts from across Britain that date to the same Early Iron Age period (Manning & Saunders 1972: 282); a comparable socketed and looped iron axe from the river Thames had part of its wooden shaft preserved in the socket (Barclay et al 1995), recently radiocarbon dated to the bc (2480  ñ  50 bp) between 790 cal bc and 410 cal bc. Analysis of the evidence at Kildalloig (NR71NW 11) suggests it too has origins earlier than the 1st millennium ad. It was dated to the 2nd century ad by a bronze Collingwood Group Q head-stud Roman under a midden against the west wall of the roundhouse (Bigwood 1964: 19; RCAHMS 1971: 88). However, this deposit need not be original to the roundhouse construction, and has no stratigraphic link to the interior of the structure, indeed an analogous paved area and ?catwalk? around the exterior of Loch na Beirgh complex Atlantic roundhouse in Lewis relates to much later tertiary re-use (NB13NW 3; Harding & Gilmour 2000). A similar claim of secondary deposition could be made for the 1st millennium ad material recovered from Ardifuar, midArgyll (Christison et al 1905: 267?9). The material, including 2nd century ad Samian sherds and 6th to 7th century ad E-ware, is likely to originate from within a secondary internal cellular building incorporating revetted vertical slabbing which was not removed during these early excavations. No diagnostic material was recovered from Druim an Duin (NR79SE 1) but it too had recognisable secondary re-use (op cit: 287). Dn M¢r Vaul represents the only excavated, dated and published ?broch? or complex Atlantic roundhouse in Argyll (MacKie 1974), but the radiocarbon dates from this site are unfortunately prone to error and wide deviation (Lane 1990; Ashmore 1997: 240). However, if taken at face value they could be argued to represent 1st millennium bc construction of this complex Atlantic roundhouse site prior to the 1st century bc. Dn M¢r Vaul also has well-documented reuse including the insertion of a secondary roundhouse with coursed masonry, and external vertical slabbed cellular structures. The recent excavations at Tirefour ?broch? or complex Atlantic roundhouse (NM84SE 1), while unable to investigate the interior, has produced radiocarbon dates for its associated external works in the second half of the 1st millennium cal bc (Simon Stoddart pers comm). This chronology and secondary-use is comparable to that argued for Atlantic roundhouses elsewhere in western and northern Scotland (Gilmour 2005) and suggests that the Argyll sites are indeed part of a wider Atlantic continuum (Henderson 2007: 161?4). These similarities suggest that Atlantic roundhouses in Argyll should be dated to the second half of the 1st millennium bc. The dating evidence from Glashan certainly supports such a view, and its architectural traits and artefactual remains provide interesting material with which to compare other Iron Age sites in Argyll.","Gilmour and Henderson, S and J C.ÿ(2003)ÿ'Loch Glashan Dun (Kilmichael Glassary parish), simple atlantic round house or dun', Discovery Excav Scot, vol. 4, 2003.

Evidence for two burning events was uncovered, after both of which the site was rebuilt and reused for several centuries before abandonment. Posthole alignments in the entrance passage and interior courtyard showed evidence for the construction of timber structures inside both areas. Other structural evidence uncovered included later interior walling used to constrict the courtyard space and two successive central slab-built hearths, the last of which contained broken quern fragments; revealed the use of local woodland resources and the presence of domesticated livestock on the site. Oak appears to have been the main timber used for internal structural support posts, while birch and hazel were also probably utilised for structural purposes. Analysis of the small finds, which included no ceramics, concluded that although many of the items could be associated with manufacturing activities, the scarcity of material recovered could reflect limited occupation of the site, possibly suggesting it had a specific non-domestic use; the dun?s entrance passage recorded substantial postholes, some complete with packing stones, forming a roofed porch, a main post ring and an inner post ring to the structure. Deposits associated with the postholes and entrance portal provided evidence for intense burning, including some large fragments of vitrified stone. Sections of burnt roof timbers were also recovered along with ash deposits relating to the burning of peat or turf, which may provide evidence of a turf roof for the dun. there did appear to be a possible intramural cell within the rubble-built walling. On the inside of the dun wall and overlying an earlier posthole, there also appeared to be an inner bank of stone relating to a secondary phase of use and restructuring. ; Two clear phases of use were identified. An internal hearth consisted of a well-built stone setting with upright edge stones overlying two earlier hearth features. The earliest
being a scoop in the natural subsoil that had been baked hard through use (and was filled with a reddish-coloured peat ash). This was overlain by the partially robbed out remains of a slab-built hearth and associated charcoal-rich deposits, over which had been built the final hearth. Some of the kerb stones surrounding the large upper slab-built hearth appeared to relate to the underlying robbed out hearth, while small post and stakeholes to the side of the hearth probably related to hearth ?furniture? for suspending cooking pots. Few small finds were recovered and there was no pottery. A lower rotary quern stone had been incorporated into the slab construction of the upper hearth setting, along with a
flat, polished rubbing stone; while a fragment of an upper rotary quern stone (including a central hopper-hole and off-set handle hole) was recovered from a linear stone setting to the S of the hearth. The remaining small finds consisted of one small fragment of sheet bronze with a small perforation hole and several small pebble tools.; charcoal and burnt bone were recovered. The dun appears to have been destroyed by fire during two phases of use, with areas of the underlying subsoil partially vitrified through the intense heat.","DES2013: 109 Comar Wood Dun.

The broch deposit contained one fragment of late 1st century, and several pieces of 2nd century Roman samian ware and some pieces of Roman glass. There was a complete absence of native pottery from the site. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the broch was destroyed about AD 45 +/- 120 and the promontory fort, about AD 110 +/- 150. ; Several of these early post-holes form anarc of a circle, and may be the remains of awooden hut about 5.6 m in diameter the centre ofwhich was well away from the centre of the brochcourt (fig. 4). No artefacts were found in theseearly post-holes but a group of sheep bones in onegave a C-14 date of AD 80 ñ 70 (GU 1370),equivalent to a time span in calendar yearscentred on about AD 100 (Ralph, Michael &Han 1973, 9). Some Roman sherds found on thesubsoil, described below, are probably to beassociated with this hut. ;Fortunatelytwo pieces of Samian ware were stratified un-equivocally under the primary broch floordeposits and rested directly on the reddish sandysubsoil; both were of Flavian date (c.AD 80-100) and one was a piece of a hemispheri-cal bowl of south Gaulish design with the potter'sstamp preserved. This has been read by Mr Hart-ley as probably FLAVIUS AUSfTINUS?) andthe piece can be dated to the period AD 75-110.Most of the pottery found in the primary brochlevels is of the same date (Table 1) and thechronological significance of this is discussedbelow. It is clear that the Leckie broch was builtafter, and quite possibly soon after, AD 79 or 80; On top of the primaiy broch floor there wereclear signs of burning in the form of many frag-ments of fired clay daub -presumably frominternal wattle-and-daub screens -and of a heapof charred barley near a rotary quern. Thesegrains gave a C-14 date of AD 45 ñ 120 (GX2779), equivalent to a calendar year time spancentred on about AD 70 (Ralph, Michael & Han1973, 9). Scatters of barley grains were foundover large parts of the interior and neatly definedthe destruction level in many places.The massive wooden posts of the main ringwere pulled bodily out of their sockets at this timeand several fresh pieces of fired daub and someentire artefacts fell into these together with blackearth from the floor deposits. well preserved iron objects like a pairof sheep shears, a foot plough areas chrom, a swordblade, a cauldron hook and several small spearheads and knife blades. The latest dateable material from the brochlevels is a piece of Samian pottery belonging tothe period AD 125-150, and presumably avail-able in central Scotland only after the Romanarmy re-conquered the southern halfof the coun-try in AD 140, in the reign of Antoninus Pius.This piece was slightly below the destructionlevel but three more Antonine fragments werefound in it; however most of the Phase 3 Romanpottery was of Flavian (late first century) date.The shattered mirror is of first century manufac-ture and, like the Flavian pottery and glass, musthave been kept safely inside the broch for manyyears. Dating evidence for Phase 4 consists of someSamian pottery of Antonine date (aboutAD 140-160), two Flavian fragments and twosilver denarii; these last were of Trajan (minted inabout AD 105) and, surprisingly, of JuliusCaesar and minted in about 45 BC. The coins,especially the Republican one, were obviouslyalready very old by Phase 4 times althoughTrajanic coins are not uncommon on Antoninesites.

These consisted of a layer of earth and stones, containing Roman material, which had been immediately below the ash layer explored in 1892. Under this was the old ground surface, cut into which were three pits ? which contained Roman material ? and nine post-holes forming a sub-circular ring which did not. This hut ? which had a maximum diameter of some 6.5m ? was therefore deduced to belong to the hillfort period. A hearth was found which was assumed to belong to the hut although it was rather close to the supposed doorway. There was a fourth pit which was earlier [4, fig. 6] and which contained sherds of native pottery (as did the hillfort ditch).  Roman material was found in the core and on the old ground surface beneath. Pit 1, in the doorway to the stair, also contained Roman sherds and must have antedated the building of the broch, if only by a short time. Roman pottery was also found scattered on the floor of the guard chamber, in the entrance passage and on the causeway across the broch ditch leading to this. By contrast not a single Roman fragment was found in any of the many cuttings outside the area of broch and ditch. Roman pottery and glass. 1 bronze terret and 1 enamelled stud [2, figs. 10 and 11] were found in the ash layer in 1891-92. Iron Age glass: 1 fragment of an armlet with D-shaped section is of yellowish green glass with an opaque yellow inlay [2. fig. 9: 3, 366, 389]. That these armlets were in use in southern Scotland in the late first and the second centuries AD. Roman pottery: all the fragments appeared to be pre-Hadrianic and could be Flavian (late 1st century). One piece of a carrot-shaped amphora ? rare in the north ? is from the time of Claudius or Nero ?and can hardly be later than Flavian times?. three kinds of glass ? colourless, green and amber. He suggested that the amber and green pieces were typical of the 1st/2nd centuries AD; in other words they could be either Flavian or Antonine, ?but with a slight preference for the pre-Antonine. The colourless fragments are more likely to be Antonine or later; colourless glass of this type is not found in Britain before the beginning of the second century?.? . 1. 9 fragments from one tubular-rimmed bowl of form Isings 44b, dating to AD 60/65-160/170. 2. 4 fragments from one globular jar of form Isings 67c, tentatively dated to the early-to-mid 2nd century? 3. 43 fragments from a minimum of 3 cylindrical bottles, of the period AD 43-110. 4. 14 fragments of blue-green glass of form Isings 50 or 51, dated to AD 43-200. 5. 3 unidentified fragments.
